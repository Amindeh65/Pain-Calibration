# Pain-caliberation
This method can improve the accuracy of the measurement because it adjusts the temperature based on the participants' reported sensation and allows for the determination of an individual's pain and tolerance level. Four runs (6 trials in each run and 24 trials totally) of noxious heat were administered to six forearm sites using iterative adaptive logistic regression. Each stimulus lasted 13 seconds, with 1.5 seconds for ramping. Sensation was rated on a circular scale from "no sensation" to "strongest imaginable". Participants reported pain and tolerance with "yes" or "no" responses to "Painful?" and "Tolerate?" questions. Calibration's first run familiarized participants with 47째C on all sites. The second run included 45째C, 47째C, and 48.9째C stimuli twice, randomly distributed. Runs three and four included low and high temperatures based on the pain and tolerance responses of previous trials. A logistic regression based on a 90% response to pain and tolerance of previous trials was used to determine the low and high threshold and was updated after each trial.
After the final trial, low (pain) and high (tolerance)  were determined and two sites with the least mean absolute error values in rate-temperature linear regression were chosen for pain stimulation.
